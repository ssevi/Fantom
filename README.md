This time, we’re calling on you to build a brand new project on the Fantom Mainnet Blockchain! Go from zero to a real-world working application with the help and support of the Fantom team. We can’t wait to see what you are able to do!

Fantom is a fast, low-cost, and secure smart contract platform built on a unique aBFT consensus protocol. Fantom is a Solidity & Vyper compatible chain and you can easily get started building with tools you’re already familiar with: Remix, Truffle, and MetaMask.
